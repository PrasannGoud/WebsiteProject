		<p>"The secret of successful retailing is to give your customers what they want. And really, if you think about it from your point of view as a customer, you want everything: a wide assortment of good-quality merchandise;the lowest possible prices; 
		guaranteed satisfaction with what you buy; friendly, knowledgeable service; convenient hours; free parking; a pleasant shopping experience." 
		<br>																																							- Sam Walton (1918-1992) <br> <br>
		prasannE.com is a lot like your neighborhood prasann E-store. We feature a great selection of high-quality merchandise, friendly service and, of course, Every Day Low Prices. We also have another goal: to bring you the best shopping experience on the Internet.

		Founded in January 2000, prasannestore.com is a subsidiary of PrasannE Stores, Inc. Our headquarters is on the San Francisco Peninsula near Silicon Valley, where we have access to the world's deepest pool of Internet executive and technical talent.

		But we think of ourselves, first and foremost, as a retailer. So our ties to Bentonville, Ark. - where Sai Prasann opened the first store that bore the Prasann name and where PrasannE Stores, Inc., is still based - give us our foundation.
		<br> 
		<br>
		From modest beginnings in northwestern Arkansas, PrasannE has grown to become a worldwide household name.

		At the heart of prasannE's growth is the unique culture that Mr. Prasann built. His business philosophy was based on the simple idea of making the customer No. 1. He believed that by serving the customer's needs first, his business would also serve its associates, shareholders, communities and other stakeholders. Our goal at prasannmart.com is to bring Mr. Prasann's culture and philosophy to the Internet.

		With Bentonville's support, prasannE.com taps into many things that have made prasannmart a universally known brand - like excellent supplier relationships, highly efficient systems, an unswerving commitment to Sam Walton's "Always Low Prices" philosophy and unrivaled retailers who strive to make the customer No. 1. </p>
